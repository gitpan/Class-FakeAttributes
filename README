Class::FakeAttributes

Provide fake attributes for non-hash-based objects

version 0.01

Most Perl classes use hash-based objects, and subclasses can easily add more
attributes (instance data) with new hash keys.  But some classes are not based
on hashes.  A subclass of such a class can use "Class::FakeAttributes" to add
attributes (or at least to emulate doing so).
